/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ANIMATION STORYBOARD — profile gate
 *
 *  scene 1   five faces in a row. Hover lifts one and brightens its name.
 *  on pick   THE CHOSEN FACE ARCS TO THE CENTRE AND GROWS. It is one node the
 *            whole way: the roster slot goes invisible but keeps its place,
 *            and a single traveller flies between the two rectangles.
 *
 *            The curve is Motion's own `arc()`, handed to `transition.path`.
 *            x and y are given nothing but their destination; the path bends
 *            the line between. It also owns the lean — `rotate` follows the
 *            tangent, so the tilt is the curve's rather than a keyframe we
 *            keep in sync by hand.
 *
 *            The measuring is still hand-rolled FLIP, but that is now a
 *            choice rather than a constraint: `arc()` works on layout
 *            animations too, so this could be a `layoutId` pair with
 *            `transition.layout.path` and no measuring at all. The reason it
 *            is not is that the roster slot must keep its rectangle for the
 *            return, which means never unmounting it — and a layoutId pair
 *            wants exactly one of the two mounted at a time.
 *
 *            The other four do not leave at all. The picked face is removed
 *            from the row and popLayout pulls it out of flow on frame one, so
 *            the remaining four close the gap while the traveller is still
 *            climbing.
 *  scene 2   four boxes below the face, growing downward out of it from a
 *            top-edge origin. It starts at 80% OF THE ASCENT, not on landing:
 *            waiting for the face to stop would make scene 2 a screen that
 *            loads after an animation instead of the end of one. Four boxes,
 *            but ONE input — see the pad below for why. The fourth digit
 *            submits by itself.
 *  on wrong  the pad shakes, clears, and says so. The shake is imperative:
 *            the same PIN failing twice in a row is a value that did not
 *            change, and a declarative animate would do nothing the second
 *            time.
 *  on right  the pad crossfades to a welcome where it stands, and the whole
 *            bottom of the stage changes hands: the roster crossfades out, a three-tab bar
 *            crossfades in, and the face flies down into the Profile tab —
 *            all on the same clock, so it is one event and not three. The tab
 *            bar is mounted from the start at opacity 0 rather than swapped
 *            in, because the descent has to be AIMED at the Profile tab in
 *            the same commit the fade begins, and you cannot measure a
 *            rectangle that is not in the document yet.
 *
 *  scene 3   the pad leaves the moment the descent begins and is gone within
 *            the first fifth of it, so the face travels home over an empty
 *            stage rather than past a panel still fading.
 *
 *            The face arcs home and shrinks — and takes a different route
 *            back for free. `direction` is locked to the direction of TRAVEL,
 *            so the same "cw" on both legs bulges to opposite sides of the
 *            screen once the journey reverses. A path that retraces itself
 *            reads as a rewind; a different one reads as an object that went
 *            somewhere and came back. The row closes in behind it, nearest
 *            face last.
 *
 *  reduced   No arc at all. Arcs are precisely the vestibular trigger, so
 *  motion    under reduced motion the traveller cross-dissolves between the
 *            two rectangles and the row fades without moving. MotionConfig
 *            makes the transforms instant; the opacity the traveller starts
 *            at is what turns that jump into a dissolve.
