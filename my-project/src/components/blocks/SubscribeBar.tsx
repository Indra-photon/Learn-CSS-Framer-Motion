/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ANIMATION STORYBOARD — email subscription bar
 *
 *  scene 1   one narrow pill: a mail glyph and the word "Subscribe".
 *  on click  THE PILL ITSELF STAYS AND STRETCHES — same node, so the mail
 *            glyph never blinks, it just holds its place at the left as the
 *            box grows around it. The field and the Join button mount into
 *            the room that opens up.
 *  on submit the pill holds its width. A small spinner pops in at the left of
 *            the label while the word GROWS — "Join" never remounts, the
 *            letters "i" "n" "g" mount onto the end of it one at a time. When
 *            the request resolves the spinner pops back out, "ing" is replaced
 *            by "ed", and the confetti fires from the button itself.
 *  then      the field and button leave and the pill pulls in around
 *            "You're subscribed", which drops in from above. Nothing to press:
 *            after a beat the pill simply returns to where it started, so the
 *            whole run is one round trip rather than a state you must dismiss.
 *  on undo   plays in reverse, flat and quick.
 *
 * Same architecture as FeedbackSwitch: one persistent node doing the morph
 * with `layout` (never `layoutId`), every child on `layout="position"` so the
 * box's scale correction cannot smear it, and only *content* mounting and
 * unmounting inside. The difference is that this pill morphs TWICE in a row —
 * idle → typing → done — which is why the box never unmounts at any point.
