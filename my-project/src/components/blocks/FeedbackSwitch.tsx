 *            never blinks, it just slides left as the pill grows around it.
 *            The other pill is the only thing that unmounts, popping out of
 *            flow so the survivor glides into the space rather than waiting.
 *  arriving  "Feedback Received!" drops in from above, blurred; the Undo
 *            capsule slides in from the right edge it is anchored to.
 *  undo      plays in reverse and the second pill returns.
 *
 * Same architecture as ApproveSwitch v2: one persistent node per option,
 * `layout` (not `layoutId`) doing the morph, and only *content* mounting and
 * unmounting inside it.
